# Web-Crawler
Crawler em Python para sites comerciais e comparação de preços


1) The client wanted a real-time price comparison of meat prices with other markets, something quick and easy to implement.
2) My collaboration was to program the routine and play it in a jupyter-notebook for easy didactic sharing. I created a routine in Python to enter the sites initially submitted by the client, going in tab by tab to extract the necessary information and feed the database.
3) Once concluded, the customer was able to compare their own prices with the competition prices and better position themselves in the next negotiations with suppliers.
